REACT => It is a js library which is used to develop UI or frontend
It is developed by facebook

WHY??
1.Very fast
2.Easy event handling(shortcuts provide kar deta hai)
3.It's a small library and easy to learn
4.It manages UI by statements



COPONENTS=>Chhote chhote components me break kar lete hai aur jo change ho rha hai sirf usi ko badalte hai baki page ka elements same rehta hai wo sab nhi change hota hai

JSX => It allows us to write HTML inside the Javascript and place them in the DOM without using function like appendChild() or createElement() As stand in the official docs of React.JSX provides symetric sugar for React createElement() function

RURLES=>What is not allowed ?

No varible declaration 
No function declaration
No loops for,while and do while not allowed
If else condition not allowed
We cant render objects

Static UI => Functional components, hooks
Dynamic=>Class components 
State => React object hai jiske pass information / properties hai react component ki
Render => jo bhi hum class component k ander render pe likhte hai wo UI pe display hota hai
Jab bhi state change hoti hai to react ko pata hota hai ki render phirse chalana hai
